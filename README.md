# Simple-Password-Generator: 

## Summary ðŸ“‹

This browser-based application allows users to generate a random password based on selected criteria. The application, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS driven by JavaScript code, ensures a responsive and polished user interface across various screen sizes. 

The generated password, inclusive of special characters, is triggered upon button click after users respond to prompts specifying password length (8 to 128 characters) and selecting at least one character type. The resulting password is then displayed directly to the page.
